Uptime Clock utilizes the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays a continuously updating clock showing the system's uptime since its last boot. It achieves this by employing the psutil library to fetch the exact time the system was last started and then calculating the difference from the current time to determine the uptime. This uptime is displayed in a simple window with a label that refreshes every second, providing real-time visibility into how long the computer has been running. The program is designed to be user-friendly and informative, suitable for anyone interested in monitoring their system's operational duration without needing to use command-line tools.
